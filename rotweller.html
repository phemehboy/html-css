              The Rottweiler (/ˈrɒtwaɪlər/, UK also /-vaɪlər/, German:
              [ˈʁɔtvaɪ̯lɐ]) is a breed of domestic dog, regarded as
              medium-to-large[3][4] or large. The dogs were known in German as
              Rottweiler Metzgerhund, meaning Rottweil butchers' dogs, because
              their main use was to herd livestock and pull carts laden with
              butchered meat to market. This continued until the mid-19th
              century when railways replaced droving. Although still used to
              herd stock in many parts of the world, Rottweilers are now also
              used as search and rescue dogs, guard dogs, and police dogs.
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              According to the FCI Standard, the Rottweiler is considered to be
              one of the oldest surviving dog breeds. Its origin goes back to
              Roman times. These dogs were kept as herder or driving dogs. They
              marched over the Alps with the Roman legions, protecting the
              humans and driving their cattle. In the region of Rottweil, these
              dogs met and mixed with the native dogs in a natural crossing. The
              main task of the Rottweiler now became the driving and guarding of
              the herds of cattle and the defence of their masters and their
              property. This breed acquired its name from the old free city of
              Rottweil and was known as the "Rottweil butcher's dog". The
              butchers bred this type of dog purely for performance and
              usefulness. In due course, a first rate watch and driving dog
              evolved which could also be used as a draught dog
            </p>
            <p>
              The buildup to World War I saw a great demand for police dogs,
              which led to a revival of interest in the Rottweiler. During the
              First and Second World Wars, Rottweilers saw service in various
              roles, including as messenger, ambulance, draught, and guard dogs.
